## Klipper Software

Any Troodon printer purchased in 2024 or beyond likely already has a reasonably current version of Klipper already installed. But as with any software, it is often a good idea to have the latest version installed. This ensures that you have the latest bug and security fixes, but also the latest capabilities.
And updating Klipper itself usually just takes a few clicks. After logging into the web interface for your printer, select the "Machine" option from the left menu. This brings up the list of packages currently installed, as well as whether any updates or upgrades are available.

From here, you can use the UI to directly perform these updates. Many will require a reboot. And it is usually a good idea to have a look at the GitHub page or release notes in case something extra is required.
