## TAP Upgrades

TAP comes configured by default on Troodon printers. This is a mechanism incorporated into the print head that uses the nozzle of the print head directly to determine the relative height of the bed surface. This is used primarily in quad-gantry-levelling (QGL), where it taps the four corners. 
It is also used in bed mesh levelling, where it touches an array of points across the print surface to determine its shape. This information is then used to build up a model to help ensure that the filament is laid down consistently, no matter the condition of the build surface.

Some prefer to replace this mechanism entirely, particularly as new sensors that measure eddy currents have become available. These measure considerably more points to build a more accurate mesh, and do so in much less time and without physically touching the bed. We'll cover those in this section. 

As the default TAP mechanism is made of plastic, an easy improvement is to replace it with a metal CNC part. Several such designs are readily available, with the Vitalii CNC TAP being a particular favorite. As is often the case, a variation without the name "Vitalii" can be found on AliExpress. 
Generally, searching for "Voron CNC Mount" is likely to turn up any number of similar products.

Note that as is often the case, variations of this product can be found from multiple vendors with a broad range of prices and delivery charges.

There are of course other options, including an entire replacement for TAP if some part of it has become damaged. One popular alternative is the Chaotic Lab TAP product, also available from multiple vendors.
