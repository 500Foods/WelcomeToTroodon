# Recylcing Waste Prints
While 3D printers give us the freedom to create plastic parts of any kind, A certain amount of waste plastic IS produced. Even when the printer is running perfectly well, there is still going to be waste. And when things aren't going so well, the amount of waste quickly multiplies.
- Waste is created when first loading filament into the printer, where a small amount is extruded initially.
- Clipping the filament tip when it is messy prior to loading it into the printer.
- Very small bits of filament left on the end of the roll.
- Prints that fail for one reason or another and cannot be used
- Support material when a print has overhangs
- Skirts, brims, and rafts used to improve the success rate of prints
- Nozzle primes and other routine calibrations like temperature towers and so on

It all adds up to a sizable portion. Keeping it clean and sorted is key to being able to do anything with the waste after. 

But what can we do with this stuff? One option is to send it away for recycling by a local depot or another service of some kind. 

We can also recycle it ourselves, but this often is significantly more effort than it might seem. First it has to be broken down or pelletized. Then it has to be formed into something useful.

## Sending it Away
While sending waste material to your local recycling facility might seem ideal, the reality is that there are very, very few facilities that are set up to accept plastic waste, even when separated and labeled. 
In fact, something like only 6% of all plastic waste sent to recycling facilities is recycled. Most of it is just burned or buried.

In some places, there are programs where you can send filament in and get a discount on purchasing recycled filament. While this hasn't become widespread, it seems to be a solid approach.

Before tossing your waste filament in the trash or pursuing the other options we have here, be sure to check with your local recycling facility to see what programs are available in your region.

## Waste Filament
Plastic that hasn't been through the printer - waste filament - might still have some use. While longer bits of filament left on a roll when it is nearly used up can be fused together into a longer spool. 
There are several tools available to help with this. The principle is very simple - align the two ends and apply heat and pressure until they fuse together. Usually with a guide so that the weld joint conforms to the same 1.75mm diameter of the filament.

One option is to use a tool that helps with the alignment. In this case, the filament is aligned in the open space, and then a lighter is used to melt the filament. They are then pushed together and through the small hole to achieve the welded result.

Another option is to use a tool that has a heater built into the design. In this case, the filament is joined in a clamp which then heats up to perform the weld.

Whether one of these options is used, or something else, you'll end up with longer lengths of filament that can then be used normally. If done properly there should be no difference in how it is used or the output quality of the prints as this is in essence the same filament.

## Waste Plastic - Breaking it Down
Depending on the size of the waste, there are different options. 
The option that spurred the creation of this document is the idea of using a blender. 
This is not a new idea of course, but its lack of popularity in comparison to other approaches is kind of curious. But it seemed workable, particularly with a high-powered blender.
So I gave it a try...

...and it worked pretty well! 

A few notes and caveats, however.
- This is the Sieve used: [Thingiverse - 2mm Sieb Sieve Sandspielzeug Sand Toy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4277134)
- This is the blender used: [Amazon ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ - Canddi Commercial Quiet Blender, 2200W](https://a.co/d/01p0vlCe)
- The recycled material was ASA which has a very high melting point
- It did take a bit of time to break down the densest pieces but it made it through all the material
- A blender with an extra shroud (like this one) helps greatly to minimize the dust and material. *Highly recommended.*
- This can be a very messy process any dust escaping will go everywhere.
- It also came with a tamper. It may help speed up breaking down the largest chunks, but isn't strictly necessary.
- Bread bags were used (double-bagged!) to store the resulting ground-up filament.

NOTE: Blending printer waste will reduce some of it to very fine particles. That then become airborne. And VOCs can also be released. So best to wear a good mask with an activated charcoal filter if the material you're blending warrants it. 

NOTE: Blending printer waste will reduce some of it to very fine particles. This is generally undesirable as it breaks down some of the bonds in the plastic that give it strength. Filament produced from waste recycled in this way is thus likely to be less strong and of less quality generally. This effect varies with the type of material used, however.

For anyone else wanting to give this a try, I deliberately chose the least expensive of the highest-powered blenders. Once used for this purpose, it would take a good deal of cleaning to be able to use it as a regular blender again. There are certainly more expensive blenders, but the 2200W 3HP motor running at 38,000rpm made quick work of pretty much everything thrown at it. Whether it will be as effective with prints in materials other than ASA is yet to be determined.

How fine does it need to be? That largely depends on what you want to do with it. I used a 2mm sieve thinking that I'll ultimately be recycling it into new filament. 
This size helps ensure that any kind of filament tool, or even a toolhead supporting pellets, will be able to use this directly. Larger chunks would take less time to blend, however, and may result in stronger filament once it has been re-extruded. But it will also take up more volume.

On the other hand, if you're going to press the material into large plates or push it through an injection molding process, it likely doesn't matter so much and can be much larger. 

## Then What?
My main objective was to get the material into a form that can be fed into some kind of machine for producing filaments. Like the shred-it options, these tend to be very expensive with all kinds of caveats. But the hope is that in time, this will be addressed and more consumer-friendly machines will appear on the market. 

As mentioned above, there are other options. An injection molding machine is one. In this scenario, a mold fashioned out of something like aluminum is used with a press to push heated plastic down a heated tube into a mold. This works great when you want to produce many of the same parts, and ultimately is more efficient and far quicker than 3D printing. The catch is that the machine is a bit large and can be expensive, but machining molds is prohibitively expensive for casual use. The waste material must also be small enough to fit into the heated tube. 

Another alternative is making plastic sheets, not unlike the back panel on a typical printer like a Voron or a Troodon. A press is used again, but the waste plastic is just laid out in a plate which is then compressed with another plate and then heated. Similar to injection molding, really, but different and with different price points and options. In this case, the waste filament chunks can be significantly larger, particularly if you mix different colors in to get a more random effect.

Yet another option is to fill silicone baking molds and then heat them in the oven. Great for making simpler shapes, letters, and so on. Will give this one a try first.
