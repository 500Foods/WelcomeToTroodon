# Recylcing Waste Prints
While 3D printers give us the freedom to create plastic parts of any kind, A certain amount of waste plastic IS produced. Even when the printer is running perfectly well, there is still going to be waste. And when things aren't going so well, the amount of waste quickly multiplies.
- Waste is created when first loading filament into the printer, where a small amount is extruded initially.
- Clipping the filament tip when it is messy prior to loading it into the printer.
- Very small bits of filament left on the end of the roll.
- Prints that fail for one reason or another and cannot be used
- Support material when a print has overhangs
- Skirts, brims, and rafts used to improve the success rate of prints
- Nozzle primes and other routine calibrations like temperature towers and so on

It all adds up to a sizable portion. Keeping it clean and sorted is key to being able to do anything with the waste after. 

But what can we do with this stuff? One option is to send it away for recycling by a local depot or another service of some kind. 

We can also recycle it ourselves, but this often is significantly more effort than it might seem. First it has to be broken down or pelletized. Then it has to be formed into something useful.

## Sending it Away
While sending waste material to your local recycling facility might seem ideal, the reality is that there are very, very few facilities that are set up to accept plastic waste, even when separated and labeled. 
In fact, something like only 6% of all plastic waste sent to recycling facilities is recycled. Most of it is just burned or buried.

In some places, there are programs where you can send filament in and get a discount on purchasing recycled filament. While this hasn't become widespread, it seems to be a solid approach.

Before tossing your waste filament in the trash or pursuing the other options we have here, be sure to check with your local recycling facility to see what programs are available in your region.

## Waste Filament
Plastic that hasn't been through the printer - waste filament - might still have some use. While longer bits of filament left on a roll when it is nearly used up can be fused together into a longer spool. 
There are several tools available to help with this. The principle is very simple - align the two ends and apply heat and pressure until they fuse together. Usually with a guide so that the weld joint conforms to the same 1.75mm diameter of the filament.

One option is to use a tool that helps with the alignment. In this case, the filament is aligned in the open space, and then a lighter is used to melt the filament. They are then pushed together and through the small hole to achieve the welded result.

Another option is to use a tool that has a heater built into the design. In this case, the filament is joined in a clamp which then heats up to perform the weld.

Whether one of these options is used, or something else, you'll end up with longer lengths of filament that can then be used normally. If done properly there should be no difference in how it is used or the output quality of the prints as this is in essence the same filament.

## Waste Plastic - Breaking it Down
Depending on the size of the waste, there are different options. 

### Blender
The option that spurred the creation of this document is the idea of using a blender. 
This is not a new idea of course, but its lack of popularity in comparison to other approaches is kind of curious. But it seemed workable, particularly with a high-powered blender.
So I gave it a try.
