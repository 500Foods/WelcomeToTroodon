# Grease
Grease, or lubricant, is used to ensure that the motion of the linear rails is smooth and consistent over a long period of time. 
Inside the linear rail block is a set of steel ball bearings that run along the steel rail - metal on metal. Over time, these can wear unevenly, resulting in poor performance that can directly impact print quality.
In order to lubricate these rails, [syringes](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/syringes.md) are used to inject grease into the service ports on the blocks.

For Troodon 2.0 Pro users, a generic tube of grease is included in the box with the printer. There's likely enough to last the lifetime of the printer. The alternatives below may be a better choice.

When purchasing grease, consider the following recommendations.
- Do NOT use PTFE lubricant
- White lithium grease rated NLGI 1 (ideal)
- White lithium grease rated NLGI 2 (great)
- Mobilux EP1 (ideal)
- Mobilux EP2 (great)
- Superlube 21030 (great)

There are other alternatives, like oil. In general, bear in mind that your use of the printer will largely dictate how long the lubrication lasts.
If you're printing at max speeds all day long and every day, then you might have to re-lubricate every three months, even with the best lubricant. 
If you're printing at normal speeds a few times per week, even with a lower quality lubricant, it might be years before a re-lubrication is needed.

Here are some signs that indicate that more lubrication might help.
- Any kind of noise related to the axis motion. Squeaking, that sort of thing.
- With the printer off, you should be able to move the toolhead in all directions by hand easily. Just be sure to re-align the z-axis of the gantry if you try this.
- An unusual amount of dust or debris has accumulated on the rails.
- It has been more than 2,000 print-hours since the last lubrication.

***NOTE: As of this writing, the Troodon 2.0 Pro printer ships with none of the rails lubricated. They include lubricant in the box, but not the syringes. The fine print on the tube states it is Type GT-01 and contains mineral oil and lithium soap thickener.***
