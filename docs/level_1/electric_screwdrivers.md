# Electric Screwdrivers

While technically anyone can get by with a good set of regular screwdrivers or even an allen wrench or two, the people that design 3D printers seem to be oddly infatuated with small finely-threaded machine screws. They're everywhere. And in large quantities. 
Whether you're assembling a Voron from scratch, putting together the final pieces of a Troodon, or just performing some regular maintenance, having an electric screwdriver can save a lot of time and energy. 
Fortunately, there are plenty of sets availabe on Amazon or AliExpress that come with the necessary bits and then some. 

NOTE: Be sure to pick up a bit magnetizer if the kit doesn't already come with one. It is trivial to magnetize bits, so no need to pay extra for a pre-magnetized set, but it should either come with a magnetizer or one can be purchased separately for a few dollars. Just a fancy magnet, after all.
