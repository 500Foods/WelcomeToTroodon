# Accessories
The last section listed a collection of [Tools](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/tools.md) that are good to have on-hand. Here in Accessories, we're going to cover items that are either not really tools, or that are far more specialized. Not everyone would have a use for them. Or they're something you might be interested in a little later in your 3D printing adventure. Not necessarily the first week or two.
