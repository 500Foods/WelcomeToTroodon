# Initial Tuning
While most printers, including Troodons, come already preconfigured whenever possible, there are usually a few things to keep an eye on. And if you ever make changes to anything, particularly with respect to the toolhead, then it is very likely that some calibration is in order.

- X/Y/Z Limits - How far the toolhead can move in each direction
- Belt Tensioning - Not too loose, not too tight, but just right
- PID Tuning - Calibrate your heating elements for optimal performance
