# Bed Alignment Guides
Typical 3D printers these days have a solid aluminum "base plate" - often heated - and a "build plate" that is placed on top of that. Popular build plates are often flexible spring steel sheets with various surfaces, textures, patterns, and so on. 

One of the more satisfying aspects of completing a successful print is to remove the build plate from the printer and flex it to remove the part. However, when putting the build plate back into the printer, the build plate must be accurately aligned with the underlying base plate.
Some printers are equipped with guides to make it quick and easy to position the plate. For Troodons, Vorons, and others, it is possible to print bed alignment brackets that attach to the extrusions that run along the bottom of the printer below the base plate. 

For printers with a brass nozzle cleaning brush, this can sometimes interfere with the placement of the brackets. Variations of the bed alignment brackets are available to address this. For Voron printers, something like this works pretty well.

For Troodon 2.0 Pro users, the above doesn't work so well because the nozzle brush is in a slightly different location. A remix of the above by user @jamby9457 from the Troodon forum in the [Formbot Discord](https://discord.gg/spAGFK2PnN) addresses this nicely.

Note 1: Four M3x8mm bolts and 4 M3 T-Nuts will be needed. These are likely to be found in the leftover parts from a Troodon build. 

Note 2: You'll want to print these in ABS or ASA or something that supports high temperatures as it will be close to or possibly touching the heated build plate and/or heated base plate.

Note 3: Use your slicer software to create a mirrored image for the other side as well.
