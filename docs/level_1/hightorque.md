# High-Torque Screwdrivers

While electric screwdrivers can save quite a bit of time when it comes to dealing with dozens and dozens of small machine screws, they are, by design, not especially powerful. 
This is a good thing, generally, as small screws are often threaded directly into plastic and there's a good chance that the threads will get stripped if too much force is applied. 
But there are other times when you might want to tighten or loosen something where more torque is required. This is often enough to break regular precision screwdrivers if you're not careful. 
The solution? A set of high-torque screwdrivers. Super handy! Only a few sizes are usually needed - in the metric 2mm-5mm range.

Bonus points if you can get a matching black/red set.
