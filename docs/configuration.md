# ðŸª› Quick Reference - Configuration
Configuration items are typically defined in the printer.cfg file. Be careful with these customizations as the hardware in your printer may be very different than what is assumed here. 

***Note: Any changes to Klipper's printer.cfg file will require a reboot to take effect.***
