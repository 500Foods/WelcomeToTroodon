# ✂️ Quick Reference - Macros
Macros are typically defined in the printer.cfg file and these macros in particular are probably already present. Be sure to comment out any existing macro while testing changes, so you can revert back to the prior version if you encounter any problems.
- [LIGHTS_TOGGLE](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/macros/LIGHTS_TOGGLE.md) - Turn the main chamber light on or off via a macro or a KlipperScreen button
- [PRINT_START](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/macros/PRINT_START.md) - Runs whenever a new print job is sent to the printer
- [PRINT_CANCEL](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/macros/PRINT_CANCEL.md) - Runs whenever a new print job is canceled, manually or otherwise
- [TIMER](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/macros/TIMER.md) - Adds support for adding timers to other macros, particularly to PRINT_START
