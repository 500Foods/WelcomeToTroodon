# Build a TradRack MMU
Adding a multi-material unit (or MMU) to your 3D printer can greatly expand its capabilities. But MMUs aren't all that common, aside from perhaps the AMS line of products that have been created specifically for Bambu Labs' printers. 
This is because they're not the simplest mechanisms to setup or operate and they come with a host of problems, sometimes as complex as the printer itself. 

There are a number of more generic MMUs available for 3D printers. The Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder, or ERCF, is a popular choice. TradRack is another in a similar vein, albeit a bit simpler in its design.

In this HowTo, we're going to go through the steps of building a TradRack using a kit and some self-printed parts, with the goal of producing a 14-lane MMU that works perfectly well with a Troodon 2.0 Pro printer. This style of MMU would work equally well with nearly any modern Klipper-based printer, so if you fall in that category, there should be plenty of material here that you'll find helpful as well.
