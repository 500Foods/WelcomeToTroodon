# Rockers
The Troodon 2.0 Pro is a large and heavy printer. Getting into the electronics bay requires accessing the underside of the printer, and removing the bottom panel. 
So the printer has to be turned on its side or its back. This is no easy task, particularly for one person.
Unless you've got some rockers in place.
These allow you to tilt the printer onto its back much more easily, while also not damaging the cables coming out of the back of the printer.

## Step 1: Pickup some hardware

The rockers have been sized to work with M4 SHCS screws (BHCS work too) and M4 T-Nuts. The Troodon ships with M3 and M5 T-Nuts so the leftovers won't work here. YOu'll need the following.

- Qty 10: M4 T-Nuts
- Qty 6: M4 16mm SHCS - for the back
- Qty 4: M4 10mm SHCS - for the sides (I used 12mm without a problem)

## Step 2: Print the rockers

These are available on Printables:<br/>

They can be printed in PLA or something similarly strong like ASA or ABS. If you want to print them in a different color and want to print matching corner trim pieces for the front, you can find those on Printables as well:<br/>

Here's what they look like in red ASA. They feel incredibly strong!

## Step #3: Prepare the printer

The main challenge here is that the bottom screws for the back panel are M3 screws that need to be replaced with larger M4 screws, so the T-Nuts need to be replaced and larger holes for the M4 screws need to be made. 

- Remove back panel
- Slide the bottom T-Nuts out of the way
- Fit the back panel and fit the rockers in place
- Drill the larger holes through the rocker so they are in the right place

## Step #4: Fun with T-Nuts

Here we're just adding 10 T-Nuts to the existing 2020 aluminum extrusions. Here are some tips for handling T-Nuts.

- Use a small but sturdy allen key that can fit inside the M4 hole
- Make sure the ball bearing in the T-Nut is springy - no good if it is stuck
- Place the T-Nut into the 2020 slot sideways, and then use the allen key to lock it into place
- With a little luck, this won't take any force at all
- With a little more luck, they'll stay right where you place them and not drop
- They should be able to be pushed up or down using the allen key

## Step #5: Finishing up
- With all of the T-Nuts roughly positioned, fit the rocker into position
- Use the allen key to precisely position each of the t-nuts into their final spots
- Replace the back panel, leaving off the bottom screw on either side
- The enlarged holes should be aligned with the T-Nuts in those locations
- Screw in the 16mm screws at the back (3 on each side)
- Screw in the 10mm (or 12mm) screws on the sides (two on each side)
