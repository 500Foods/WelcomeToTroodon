# Between Every Print

- [ ] 🙂 Check that the nozzle is clean and give it a good brush
- [ ] 🙂 Check filament path for dust or other irregularities
- [ ] 🙂 Check the build plate surface and clean or apply adhesive as required
- [ ] 🙂 Check the build plate position if using a removable build plate
- [ ] 🙂 Review timelapse from prior print for issues
- [ ] 🙂 Check for any parts from the previous print left behind
- [ ] 🙂 Check whether there is enough filament for the next print

When changing the filament (when not using an MMU): 

- [ ] 🙂 Position the print head somewhere convenient and ensure the nozzle is clean
- [ ] 🙂 Check that the nozzle temp is appropriate for the filament being unloaded
- [ ] 🙂 Use the "Unload Filament" macro to retract the filament
- [ ] 🙂 Pull the filament out (usually from the back of the printer, not the print head)
- [ ] 🙂 Cut the end of the filament to square off the end in preparation for its next use
- [ ] 🙂 For the new filament, cut the end if it isn't already prepared for use
- [ ] 🙂 If printing from a filament dry box, check the settings of the dry box
- [ ] 🙂 Check that the nozzle temp is appropriate for the filament being loaded
- [ ] 🙂 Feed the filament until it reaches the print head
- [ ] 🙂 Use the "Load Filament" macro and check that the new filament is extruded
- [ ] 🙂 Clean out the extruded filament and give the nozzle a good brush
- [ ] 🙂 Use the "Nozzle Clean" and "Nozzle Purge" macros to ensure everything is ready
