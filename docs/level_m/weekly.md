# Weekly Maintenance (Every 100 Print Hours)
For the most part, if what you're doing between each print yields consistent results, there's not much to do each week. This is more of a quick list of things to check to ensure consistent results are the norm rather than the exception.

- [ ] ðŸ™‚ Check for any software updates via Klipper's Update Manager
- [ ] ðŸ”¨ Check belt tensions. This is much easier if you have a tool for this
- [ ] ðŸ”¨ Check for any play in the print head. It should not wiggle at all
- [ ] ðŸ”¨ Check for any play in the gantry. It should not wiggle at all
- [ ] ðŸ™‚ Check the build plate surface more closely for any damage that may warrant a replacement
- [ ] ðŸ™‚ Vacuum out the inside of the printer thoroughly to get rid of any dust build-up
- [ ] ðŸ™‚ Clean the acrylic panels inside and out
- [ ] ðŸ™‚ If using a fixed build plate (like a glass plate) run a mesh level
