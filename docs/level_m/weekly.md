# Weekly Maintenance (Every 100 Print Hours)
For the most part, if what you're doing between each print yields consistent results, there's not much to do on a weekly basis. This is more of a quick list of things to check to ensure that consistent results are the norm rather than the exception.

- [ ] Check belt tensions. Much easier if you have a tool for this.
- [ ] Check for any play in the print head. It should not wiggle at all.
- [ ] Check for any play in the gantry. It should not wiggle at all.
- [ ] Check the build plate surface more closely for any damage that may warrant a replacement
- [ ] Vacuum out the inside of the printer thoroughly to get rid of any dust build-up
- [ ] Clean the acrylic panels inside and out
- [ ] If using a fixed build plate (like a glass plate) run a mesh level
