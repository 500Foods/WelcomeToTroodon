# ðŸ™‚ Level One - Welcome!  
This list is aimed at new 3D printer owners, particularly new Troodon 3D printer owners, as well as anyone looking to get more from their existing setup. This is more about the initial few weeks with a new printer and what to have on hand to make that experience as positive and productive as possible. 
No mods here, really, as these are focused on getting up and running with what you already have out of the box with a typical stock configuration.
