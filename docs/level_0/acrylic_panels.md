## The Rear Panel

The original design leaves a minimal gap between the rear acrylic panel and the gantry. Very often, the X/Y belts touch the rear panel and resonate against it; the gantry may also scratch the panel. An easy or temporary solution is to use thicker foam between the panel and the printer, but it's impossible at the bottom since the panel slides into a designated place.

The better solution is to print inserts that add ~7.5mm of clearance and mount the panel through the inserts. Unfortunately, it means that longer screws are required for everything, for the panels, for the filament sensor, and for the spool holder.

The inserts can be printed with no top/bottom solid layers to save plastic and increase elasticity. I printed with 2 walls, 0 top/bottom layers, 20% rectilinear infill.
