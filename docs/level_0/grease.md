# Grease.
Grease, or lubricant, is used to ensure that the motion of the linear rails is smooth and consistent over a long period of time. 
Inside the linear rail block is a set of steel ball bearings that run along the steel rail - metal on metal. Over time, these can wear unevenly, resulting in poor performance that can directly impact print quality.
In order to lubricate these rails, [syringes](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/syringes.md) are used to inject grease into the service ports on the blocks.

For Troodon 2.0 Pro users, a generic tube of grease is included in the box with the printer. There's likely enough to last the lifetime of the printer. 

When purchasing grease, consider the following recommendations.
- Do NOT use PTFE lubricant
- White lithium grease
- Mobilux EP1 or EP2
- Superlube 21030

***NOTE: As of this writing, the Troodon 2.0 Pro printer ships with none of the rails lubricated. They include lubricant in the box, but not the syringes.***
