Brainstorming...
- Need heated bed
- Need enclosure
- Need active carbon filter
- Be aware of VOCs
- Higher chamber temperature is better
- Bed adhesive
    
- Each layer shrinks as it cools
- Higher layers cool more quickly than lower layers closer to the heated build plate
- This can cause corners of object to lift off of build plate, causing warping
- This can cause parts to get knocked off build plate entirely
- Fixing adhesion not the only problem - parts can lift the build plate off of aluminum base plate
- Part design can have a big impact on how cooling relates to adhesion and warping
- Solid parts are more of a problem, whereas gaps lessen the forces being applied
  

- Print monitoring applicable here - watching for parts that have been knocked out of position
