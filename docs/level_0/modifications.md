# Notes About Mods
While some printers come ready-to-print right out of the box, others have to be built from scratch. As a result, the community know-how around how these printers work is quite extensive. 
The end result is that there is a huge array of modifications that can be applied to nearly any printer. 

Sometimes these are recommended to fix various problems or common shortcomings of a particular printer. Sometimes they're entirely aesthetic. Often they're focused on improving
overall print performance and reliability. Depending on the state of your printer when it arrives, it may benefit from some trivial mods right away, while other more complex mods can be set aside for another day.

One of the ideas behind this repository is, in fact, to get a handle on all of the mods that apply specifically to Troodon printers. But many of these apply to Voron printers. Some are intended to bring the Troodon and Voron printers closer in terms of features and capabilities. 

This repository has been organized into three "levels".

- **[Level One](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/tree/main#level-one---welcome)** - No hardware mods. Just get the printer working.
- **[Level Two](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/tree/main#level-two---get-to-work)** - Basic mods that nearly anyone can perform without spending too much money.
- **[Level Three](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#level-three---more-speed)** - Advanced mods that take a bit of time, experience, and money, but can dramatically improve the capabilities of the printer.

Mods in this context generally refer to hardware mods - replacing or adding parts, wiring, electronics or some other bits that change or modify how the printer works. But mods come in all shapes and sizes. 
One could also define a mod as changing a software setting or a parameter somewhere, which can have as equally dramatic effects as the most complex hardware mod. Generally speaking, the "mod" term is used here to refer to hardware changes.
