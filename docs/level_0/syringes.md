# Syringes
In order to apply lubricant to the linear rails of your printer, syringes are used. These allow you to inject grease directly into the service ports on the linear rail blocks. 
With different linear rail sizes, different syringe sizes are needed. 

Inside a Troodon 2.0 Pro printer:
- For the MGN9 rails (the vertical Z rails and the rails on the left and right) 16G needles are used.
- For the MGN12 rail (the gantry rail supporting the toolhead), an 18G needle is used.
- There's also an MGN9 rail for TAP embedded inside the toolhead that should be lubricated.

***NOTE: As of this writing, the Troodon 2.0 Pro printer ships with none of the rails lubricated. They include lubricant in the box, but not the syringes.***
