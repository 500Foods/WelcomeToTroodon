# Syringes
In order to apply lubricant to the linear rails of your printer, syringes are used. This allows you to inject grease directly into the service ports on the blocks. 
With different linear rail sizes, different syringe sizes are needed. 
- For MGN9 rails (the vertical Z rails and the rails on the left and right) 16G needles are used.
- For the MG12 rails (the gantry rail supporting the toolhead), 18G needles are used.
- There's also a rail for TAP embedded inside the toolhead that should be lubricated.
