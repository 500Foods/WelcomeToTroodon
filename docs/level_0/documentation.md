# Documentation
When ordering a new 3D printer (in the case of Troodon, at least) it will come (often via e-mail in advance) with a user manual, setup manual, or installation manual of some kind. These typically have online versions as well as alternative guides made by third parties. For Troodon printers, the Team Gloomy guide addressess a few issues in the original FormBot guide, so that might be a better guide to follow when first putting together your new Troodon. Ellis' Print Tuning Guide is applicable to many 3D printers and comes highly recommended by many people.
