# Vendor Websites
When it comes time to buy products, the usual suspects - Amazon and AliExpress - are often the most popular. But there are also quite a few 3D printer-specific vendors that have proven to be both popular and reliable. 
It is important to keep an eye on shipping - costs, times, and product availability. Often something on Amazon can be found on AliExpress for much less, but with substantial shipping delays. And buying things one-at-a-time is
surely going to add to the cost, so be sure to combine orders at each vendor to ensure the best shopping (and shipping) experience. And do shop around! There are plenty of great people competing hard for your business, so don't be shy.
