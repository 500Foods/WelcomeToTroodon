# PLA
PLA (PolyLactic Acid) is easily the most popular 3D printer filament, and with good reasons.
- Generally the least expensive.
- Comes in the most colors.
- Many formulations for high speed, strength, etc.
- Many finish variations like matte vs. silk.
- Doesn't need an enclosure.
- Minimal shrinking/warping.
- Excellent for high-speed printing.
- Readily available everywhere.
- Drying may not be required.

Nothing special is required for printing PLA, and it is generally recommended to start with this filament when beginning your 3D printer adventures given its forgiving nature.

Typical printer settings:
- Extruder temperature: 220C
- Bed temperature: 60C
- Chamber: Doors open
