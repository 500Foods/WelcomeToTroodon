# Linear Rails
In order to move the toolhead around the volume that a given printer supports, linear rails are a popular choice. These come in assorted flavors, like everything else. Different sizes, colors, and so on. One common aspect of linear rails is that they need periodic maintenance and cleaning, as the lubrication contained within the carriage can collect dirt. Fortunately, this doesn't need to be done very often.

However, the stock Troodon 2.0 Pro ships with unlubricated linear rails. They provide the [lithium grease](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/grease.md), but not the [syringe](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/syringes.md). Head over to those pages to find out more. When setting up the printer for the first time, all of the linear rails should be lubricated. This is much easier to do before the printer is assembled.

Each carriage has a fill port that can be accessed using a syringe to push lithium grease into the carriage. After assembly, using syringes with flexible tips makes this a bit of an easier process. 

## TAP Linear Rail
The TAP linear rail is positioned between the StealthBurner toolhead and the main gantry. After assembly, it can be accessed from the bottom.
