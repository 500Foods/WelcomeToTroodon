# üßê Fussy Filaments
A critical aspect of 3D printing relates to the type of filament used. While there are many websites that go on at length about the properties of each filament type, at the end of the day it comes down to how well the printer can process the filament being fed to it. There are differences in filament quality between vendors, and sometimes even between colors or batches of the same filament type from the same vendor. There can also be differences related to how dry the filament is. Here is a brief look at the most common filament types and what to plan for in terms of printer capabilities, modifications, settings, and so on.

- [PLA](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/pla.md) - Most common, easiest to start with, least expensive
- [PETG](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/petg.md) - More durable, less brittle, quite popular
- [TPU](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/tpu.md) - Much more flexible and sometimes even stretchy
- [ABS / ASA](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/abs.md) - Better for high-temperature environments
- [Nylon](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/nylon.md) - Not as strong but very durable, more expensive
- [Additives](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/additivies.md) - Glass and Carbon Fiber take things up a notch
- [Others](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/others.md) - Many, many more options to choose from
