# ðŸ¤“ Effort, Expertise, and Expense
Almost any kind of upgrade or modification to your printer will require something - a bit of time, a bit of know-how, or a bit of money. Sometimes more than one, and sometimes much more than a bit. To help, a simple rating system has been used throughout these pages. Naturally, everyone values their own time, skills, and money differently. What might be cheap for one person might be out of the question for someone else. The same goes for time and talent - there's a reason why we don't all have Vorons!
