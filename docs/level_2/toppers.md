# Toppers
While the top of a typical enclosed 3D printer is generally quite sufficient to meet its needs, there are scenarios where changes might be beneficial. 

- **Space** - If the system has been upgraded to use CAN Bus or a CPAP cooling system, there may be a large and somewhat less flexible umbilical coming out of the top of the print head.
           This may limit the z-height originally available for printing as it can't bend enough before colliding with the top panel.
- **Venting** - Some filaments benefit from additional cooling. One way is to just leave the front doors open to allow air to circulate. Another is to remove the top acrylic panel, or at least pop it up a bit to allow the hot air to escape.
          Most of the time, these panels are fitted in a more permanent arrangement, so something different would be needed to get this to work conveniently for this purpose.
- **Mounting** - There are a few things that might benefit from being directly mounted to the top of the printer. Handles, cameras, and multi-color/multi-material systems come immediately to mind.
- **Volume** - Or, for the more ambitious, perhaps you're just looking to directly increase the available vertical print volume. Aside from replacing the top, the Z-belts would have to be extended as well as the linear rails in each corner.

A practical approach is to build a new frame top out of 2020 aluminum extrusions, similar to what the existing frame is built with. Then, common connection methods can be used for attaching whatever you want to the extrusions. T-Nuts are a typical example.

For the Troodon 2.0 Pro specifically, there are a number of additional considerations.
- The top is a steel plate rather than extrusions like in a typical Voron 2.4 printer, for example. The top acrylic panel attaches to this plate, as do the four z-tensioners.
- If you want to remove the steel plate, you'll need to find a way to also replace the z-tensioners with a different solution, or potentially longer belts.
- You can also choose to leave the steel plate and just remove the acrylic panel, building on top of the steel plate rather than replacing it.
- Whatever option you choose, you'll need to provide new acrylic panels for whatever height has been added as well as a new top panel if you're not using the same steel sheet.

## Option 1 - Keep Steel Plate
The four vertical 2020 extrusions in a Troodon 2.0 Pro already have holes drilled in them, making for relatively easy connections. The steel plate is thin enough that keeping it in place and just removing the acrylic plate gives ample room for toolhead movement.

## Opton 2 - Replace Steel Plate
TBD.
