# TradRack
[TradRack by Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/TradRack) is an MMU for 3D printers that has been designed for scalability and low-cost. Cheaper than an ERCF, and with more channels (14!), this is available in kit form or the parts can be sourced separately. As with many such kits, there are quite a number of pieces that have to be printed as well. What follows is a bit of a build log for getting a TradRack MMU set up to work with a Troodon 2.0 Pro printer.
