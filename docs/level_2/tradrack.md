# TradRack
[TradRack by Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/TradRack) is an MMU for 3D printers that has been designed for scalability and low-cost. Cheaper than an ERCF, and with more channels (14!), this is available in kit form or the parts can be sourced separately. As with many such kits, there are quite a number of pieces that have to be printed as well. What follows is a bit of a build log for getting a TradRack MMU set up to work with a Troodon 2.0 Pro printer.

## The Kit
There are different variations of the TradRack kit available and from various sources. What is covered below describes the kit from Aliexpress, [TradRack - Set A](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006702643127.html), purchased in June 2024 for $172 CAD (about $126 USD). This particular set includes the following.
- Hardware for 14-Channel TradRack 1.0
- Binky Encoder
- Two TMC2209 Drivers
- EASYBRD 1.1
- Entry Sensor
- Tolhead Sensor
- Toolhead Cutter
 
## Printed Parts

The [TradRack GitHub](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/TradRack/tree/main) has the STLs for this, as well as options for mounting to different surfaces. To get the correct parts for printing, looking through what shipped in the BOM reveals the following.
- Linear Rail with C Carriage
- 9mm Gates Belts
- 10mm x 10mm Cable Chain

From there, the appropriate parts can be selected from the STLs folder. The files are also identified by whether they should be printed in an alternate color. Instructions for different nozzles are provided. These were printed in ASA with the standard 0.4mm nozzle, no supports needed, and no special options were chosen. All in, the standard color parts came to around 400g, and the accent color parts came to around 200g of filament. There was room to print all the parts for each color on a single print run on a Troodon 2.0 Pro with a 350mm bed.
