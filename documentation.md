When you ordered your printer (in the case of Troodon, at least) you were likely sent a copy of the Troodon user manual. There's an online version, as well as alternative guides. The Team Gloomy guide actually addressess a few issues in the original FormBot guide, so that might be a better guide to follow when first putting together your new Troodon. And Ellis' Print Tuning Guide is applicable to many 3D printers and comes highly recommended by many people.
