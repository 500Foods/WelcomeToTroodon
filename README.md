# Welcome To Troodon
This repository was created primarily as a community resource for those with a new [Troodon 3D printer](https://www.formbot3d.com/collections/troodon-390). Much of the content that follows applies equally well to many other 3D printers. The Troodon 2.0 Pro, in particular, is a very close relative of a 350mm Voron 2.4R2 printer. The majority of the content here applies directly to those printers as well.

## Getting Started Resources
Even before your printter is up and running, there are plenty of resources to check out. Both to learn more about 3D printing in general, if you are new to this space, and for considerably more in-depth knowledge about getting the most out of your printer.
- [Documentation](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/documentation.md) - User Manuals and Online Guides
- [Discord](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/discord.md) - Connect with users and vendors of popular prints and products
- [Vendor Websites](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/vendors.md) - Vetted suppliers with a history of delivering on their promises
- [YouTube Videos](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/youtubers.md) - Helpful accounts to follow, covering a wide range of topics
 
## Level One - Welcome! 
This list is aimed at new 3D printer owners, particularly new Troodon 3D printer owners, as well as anyone looking to get more from their existing setup. This is more about the initial few weeks with a new printer and what to have on hand to make that experience as positive and productive as possible.

- [Software](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/software.md) - Get everything up to date
- [Tools](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/tools.md) - What you need to perform basic assembly, maintenance, and repairs
- [Accessories](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/accessories.md) - Not strictly required, but a few things to help 
- [Chemicals](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/chemicals.md) - Keep these on hand for quick cleanup and proper maintenance
- [Replacement Parts](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/replacment_parts.md) - Stuff is going to break, so be prepared
- [Initial Tuning](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/initial_tuning.md) - A little extra TLC goes a long way
- [First Prints](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/first_prints.md) - Good places to start
- [First Problems](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/first_problems.md) - Solutions to common problems

## Level Two - Get to work!
This list is aimed at those who might be planning for a more production-oriented environment. Maybe you're using your printer in a business. Maybe you have an Etsy store. Maybe you print a lot of the same things over and over again. Or maybe you just like to tinker. Here are modifications that can help ensure reliable prints day in and day out. And again, we're not touching anything in the main filament path of the printer, but instead focused on everything around it. Often, small updates or modifications can make a big difference in the day-to-day experience. These are intended to be on the less expensive and easy-to-implement side of the fence, accessible to most everyone without too much of a learning curve.

- [TAP Upgrades](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/tap_upgrades.md)
- TAP Alternatives
- Alternative Build Plates
- Chamber Fans/Filters
- Chamber Lighting
- Multi-Color/Material Options
- Toppers
- Advanced Calibration
- [Klipper TMC Auto Tune](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/klipper_tmc_auto_tune.md)
  
## Level Three - More speed!
Once everything is up and running smoothly, your gaze will quickly turn toward faster print speeds. No end to the available options here. Let's have a look at some of the most popular and effective options in these categories.

- CAN Bus
- Umbilicals
- Alternative Extruders
- Alternative Hotends
- Alternative Cooling (eg: CPAP)
- Alternative Controller Boards
- Alternative Pi Boards (eg: RPi 5)

## Routine Maintenance
As complex as they are, 3D printers do require some amount of ongoing routine maintenance. Both in terms of software/firmware, as well as hardware - physical maintenance. How much maintenance depends largely on how much printing is going on. But even printers sitting idle will need maintenance - perhaps even more than if they are used regularly. 

- Important Notifications
- Between Every Print
- Weekly Maintenance (or every 100 Print Hours)
- Monthly Maintenance (or every 500 Print Hours)
- Seasonal Maintenace (or every 2000 Print Hours)
