# Welcome To Troodon
This repository has been created primarily as a community resource for those with a new [Troodon 3D printer](https://www.formbot3d.com/collections/troodon-390). Troodons are very close relatives of the popular Voron series of printers. A great deal of the content here applies equally to those printers, as well as many other 3D printers. 

Note: This is a new project with many pages yet to be completed.
