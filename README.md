# Welcome To Troodon
This repository was created primarily as a community resource for those with a new [Troodon 3D printer](https://www.formbot3d.com/collections/troodon-390). Much of the content that follows applies equally well to many other 3D printers. The Troodon 2.0 Pro, in particular, is a very close relative of a 350mm Voron 2.4R2 printer. The majority of the content here applies directly to those printers as well.

## Getting Started Resources
Even before your printter is up and running, there are plenty of resources to check out. Both to learn more about 3D printing in general, if you are new to this space, and for considerably more in-depth knowledge about getting the most out of your printer.
- [Documentation](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/documentation.md) - User manuals, online guides, and other reference materials
- [Discord Communities](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/discord.md) - Connect with users and vendors of popular prints and products
- [Vendor Websites](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/vendors.md) - Vetted suppliers with a history of delivering on their promises
- [YouTube Videos](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/youtubers.md) - Helpful accounts to follow, covering a wide range of topics
- [Troodon Information](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/troodon.md) - Links to check out if you're on the fence about purchasing a Troodon
- [Notes About Mods](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_0/modifications.md) - What is a mod and why are they so popular?

## Fussy Filaments
A critical aspect of 3D printing relates to what kind of material - what filament - is being used. While there are plenty of websites that go on at length about the properties of a huge array of filaments, at the end of the day it is up to your printer to make the most of the filament you're feeding it. There are differences in filament quality between vendors, and sometimes even between colors or batches of the same filament type from the same vendor. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to the spool of filament that you have on-hand, and how well-equipped your printer is to deal with it.

- Choosing a Filament
- PLA
- PETG
- TPU
- ABS / ASA
- Nylon
- Additives
- Others

## Effort, Expertise, and Expense
Almost any kind of upgrade or modification to your printer will require something - a bit of time, a bit of know-how, or a bit of money. Sometimes more than one, and sometimes much more than a bit. To help, a simple rating system has been used throughout these pages. Naturally, everyone values their own time, skills, and money differently. What might be cheap for one person might be out of the question for someone else. The same goes for time and talent - there's a reason why we don't all have Vorons! 

|  ðŸ¤”  | Effort | Description |
|:-----:|:---------:|:---|
| ðŸ™‚ | Easy   | Items that almost everyone can (and should) implement<ul><li>Not very time-consuming, often much less than an hour</li><li>Not very complex - grandma could do it (supervised, of course)</li><li>Little or no cost - won't impact the filament budget</li></ul> <tr></tr> |

| ðŸ¥‡ | Difficult | Items that might be very beneficial but complex to implement<ul><li>More of a weekend project than an evening project</li><li>Need to do a bit of planning, watch several videos, do a bit of research</li><li>Likely the cost of several rolls of filament, or more, all-in</li><ul> <tr></tr> |
 
## ðŸ™‚ Level One - Welcome!  
This list is aimed at new 3D printer owners, particularly new Troodon 3D printer owners, as well as anyone looking to get more from their existing setup. This is more about the initial few weeks with a new printer and what to have on hand to make that experience as positive and productive as possible. 
No mods here, really, as these are focused on getting up and running with what you already have out of the box with a typical stock configuration.

## ðŸ”¨ Level Two - Get to Work!
This list is aimed at those who might be planning for a more production-oriented environment. Maybe you're using your printer in a business. Maybe you have an Etsy store. Maybe you print a lot of the same things over and over again. Or maybe you just like to tinker. Here are modifications that can help ensure reliable prints day in and day out. And again, we're not touching anything in the main filament path of the printer, but instead focused on everything around it. Often, small updates or modifications can make a big difference in the day-to-day experience. These are intended to be on the less expensive and easy-to-implement side of the fence, accessible to most everyone without too much of a learning curve.

- Alternative Pi Boards (eg: RPi 5)

## Routine Maintenance
As complex as they are, 3D printers do require some amount of ongoing routine maintenance. Both in terms of software/firmware, as well as hardware - physical maintenance. How much maintenance depends largely on how much printing is going on. But even printers sitting idle will need maintenance - perhaps even more than if they are used regularly. 

- [Notifications](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/notifications.md) - Items that need your immediate attention

- [Weekly Maintenance (Every 100 Print Hours)](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/weekly.md) - Or every 100 print hours
- [Monthly Maintenance (Every 500 Print Hours)](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/monthly.md) - Or every 500 print hours
