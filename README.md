# Welcome To Troodon
This repository was created primarily as a community resource for those with a new [Troodon 3D printer](https://www.formbot3d.com/collections/troodon-390). Much of the content that follows applies equally well to many other 3D printers. The Troodon 2.0 Pro, in particular, is a very close relative of a 350mm Voron 2.4R2 printer. The majority of the content here applies directly to those printers as well.

## Getting Started Resources
Even before your printter is up and running, there are plenty of resources to check out. Both to learn more about 3D printing in general, if you are new to this space, and for considerably more in-depth knowledge about getting the most out of your printer.

## Effort, Expertise, and Expense
Most everything will require some amount of each of these. To help narrow things down a little, a simple ranking system is used throughout this material.

- ðŸ™‚ = Easy - Items that most anyone can (and should) implement, not very complex or time-consuming, typically little or no cost, and without much time commitment
- ðŸ’ª = Medium - Items that are more involved or take a bit more time, not required or not universally applicable, and likely with a small cost
- ðŸ’€ = Hard - Items that might be very beneficial but are complex to implement, with either a significant cost or a significant time commitment, or likely both
 
## Level One - Welcome!  
This list is aimed at new 3D printer owners, particularly new Troodon 3D printer owners, as well as anyone looking to get more from their existing setup. This is more about the initial few weeks with a new printer and what to have on hand to make that experience as positive and productive as possible. 
No mods here, really, as these are focused on getting up and running with what you already have out of the box with a typical stock configuration.

- [Software and Firmware](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/software.md) - Get everything up to date
- [Tools](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/tools.md) - What you need to perform basic assembly, maintenance, and repairs
- [Accessories](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/accessories.md) - Not strictly required, but a few things to help 
- [Chemicals](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/chemicals.md) - Keep these on hand for quick cleanup and proper maintenance
- [Replacement Parts](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/replacment_parts.md) - Stuff is going to break, so be prepared
- [Initial Tuning](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/initial_tuning.md) - A little extra TLC goes a long way
- [First Prints](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/first_prints.md) - Good places to start
- [First Problems](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_1/first_problems.md) - Solutions to common problems

## Level Two - Get to Work!
This list is aimed at those who might be planning for a more production-oriented environment. Maybe you're using your printer in a business. Maybe you have an Etsy store. Maybe you print a lot of the same things over and over again. Or maybe you just like to tinker. Here are modifications that can help ensure reliable prints day in and day out. And again, we're not touching anything in the main filament path of the printer, but instead focused on everything around it. Often, small updates or modifications can make a big difference in the day-to-day experience. These are intended to be on the less expensive and easy-to-implement side of the fence, accessible to most everyone without too much of a learning curve.

## Level Three - More Speed!  
Once everything is up and running smoothly, your gaze will quickly turn toward faster print speeds. No end to the available options here. Let's have a look at some of the most popular and effective options in these categories.

- CAN Bus
- Umbilicals
- Alternative Extruders
- Alternative Hotends
- Alternative Cooling (eg: CPAP)
- Alternative Controller Boards
- Alternative Pi Boards (eg: RPi 5)

## Routine Maintenance
As complex as they are, 3D printers do require some amount of ongoing routine maintenance. Both in terms of software/firmware, as well as hardware - physical maintenance. How much maintenance depends largely on how much printing is going on. But even printers sitting idle will need maintenance - perhaps even more than if they are used regularly. 

- [Notifications](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/notifications.md) - Items that need your immediate attention
- [Between Every Print](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/every_print.md) - Good habits will save a lot of trouble down the road
- [Weekly Maintenance (Every 100 Print Hours)](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/weekly.md) - Or every 100 print hours
- [Monthly Maintenance (Every 500 Print Hours)](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/monthly.md) - Or every 500 print hours
- [Seasonal Maintenace (Every 2,000 Print Hours)](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/docs/level_m/seasonal.md) - Or every 2,000 print hours
