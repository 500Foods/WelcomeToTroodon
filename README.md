# Welcome To Troodon
This repository was created as a community resource for those with a new [Troodon 3D printer](https://www.formbot3d.com/collections/troodon-390). Still, much of the content that follows could apply equally well to most any other 3D printer you might have. Particularly if you have a Voron 3D printer, which the Troodon is a close derivative of. 

## Initial Resources
When you ordered your printer (in the case of Troodon, at least) you were likely sent a copy of the user manual for your printer. There's an online version, as well as alternative guides. The Team Gloomy guide actually addressess a few issues in the original FormBot guide, so that might be a better guide to follow when first putting together your new Troodon. And Ellis' Print Tuning Guide is applicable to many 3D printers and comes highly recommended by many people.

- [Team Gloomy Troodon Assembly Guide](https://teamgloomy.github.io/troodon_v2_assembly.html)
- [Ellis' Print Tuning Guide](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/)

Beyond the guides, Discord communities are a popular way to connect with other users. These tend to be specific to a printer or product, so we'll be sure to add more to this list as time goes on.

- [FormBot Discord](https://discord.gg/spAGFK2PnN) - The Troodon community is particularly helpful of course.

When it comes time to buy products, the usual suspects - Amazon and AliExpress - are often the most popular. But there are also quite a few 3D printer-specific vendors that have proven to be both popular and reliable. 
It is important to keep an eye on shipping - costs, times, and product availability. Often something on Amazon can be found on AliExpress for much less, but with substantial delays. And buying things one-at-a-time is
surely going to add to the cost, so be sure to combine orders at each vendor to ensure the best shopping (and shipping) experience. And do shop around! Plenty of great people out there competing for your business, so don't be shy.

And finally, there is of course an endless stream of YouTube videos related to 3D printing, with dozens more added every day. Here are a few YouTubers that come up often and are worth checking out. These are links to their YouTube channels, but you might very well find links to specific videos elsewhere in this repository.

- [YGK3D](https://www.youtube.com/@ygk3d) - Has some great videos specifically about Troodon printers
- [CNC Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen) - Tons of material on every aspect of 3D printing
- [Teaching Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@TeachingTech) - Another great resource covering many 3D printing topics
- [Dave Aldrich](https://www.youtube.com/@designbydave) - Lots of 3D printer content, even a little bit of Troodon stuff as well
  
## Level One - Welcome! 
This list is aimed at brand new 3D printer owners, particularly new Troodon 3D printer owners, or anyone looking to get more from their existing setup. We're assuming at this stage that you're not outright changing any of the parts related to your printer's main filament path here - see below for ideas about that. This is more about your initial few weeks and what kinds of things to have on hand to make that experience as positive and productive as possible.

## Level Two - Get to work!
This list is aimed at those who might be planning for a more production-oriented environment. Maybe you're using your printer in a business. Maybe you have an Etsy store. Maybe you print a lot of the same things over and over again. Or maybe you just like to tinker. Here are modifications that can help ensure reliable prints day in and day out. And again, we're not touching anything in the main filament path of the printer, but instead focused on everything around it. Often, small updates or modifications can make a big difference in the day-to-day experience. These are intended to be on the less expensive and easy-to-implement side of the fence, accessible to most everyone without too much of a learning curve.

- [TAP Upgrades](https://github.com/500Foods/WelcomeToTroodon/blob/main/tap_upgrades.md)
- TAP Alternatives
- Alternative Build Plates
- Chamber Fans/Filters
- Chamber Lighting
- Multi-Color/Material Options
- Toppers
  
## Level Three - More speed!
Once everything is up and running smoothly, your gaze will quickly turn toward faster print speeds. No end to the available options here. Let's have a look at some of the most popular and effective options in these categories.

- CAN Bus
- Umbilicals
- Alternative Extruders
- Alternative Hotends
- Alternative Cooling (eg: CPAP)
- Alternative Controller Boards
- Alternative Pi Boards (eg: RPi 5)

## Routine Maintenance
As complex as they are, 3D printers do require some amount of ongoing routine maintenance. Both in terms of software/firmware, as well as hardware - physical maintenance. How much maintenance depends largely on how much printing is going on. But even printers sitting idle will need maintenance - perhaps even more than if they are used regularly. 

- Important Notifications
- Between Every Print
- Weekly Maintenance (or every 100 Print Hours)
- Monthly Maintenance (or every 500 Print Hours)
- Seasonal Maintenace (or every 2000 Print Hours)
