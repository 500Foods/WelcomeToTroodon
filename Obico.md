# Obico

## Installation Notes

For some reason, data from the webcam wasn't making it across into Obico. Looking through the logs, there was mention of "janus" missing, so....
```sudo apt install janus```
...and after a restart of the Obico software on the Troodon, volia! The webcam feed started working.  Made me jump when it first appeared ;-)
